# Decription
Goal is to have reliable code tests for any future troubleshooting of Server Web Services. Mainly 2 types of tests :

- Internal server/system tests, scripts. That check for internal methods and scripts and tests for any data inconsistencies or errors.
- External server/cloud tests, scripts. That check for external API's and based on available structures checks all methods and data inconsistencies or errors.

## Further goals
Either by implementing some way of internet protocol troubleshooting or log collecting on server/system side. 
Accessing the troubleshooting by looking into a system like a black box, without having any source code.

## Expected outputs
- Python language tests - //TODO: Path to be added
- Java language tests - //TODO: Path to be added
- Documentation on running such tests and troubleshooting outputs of these tests - //TODO: Link to documentation
- Protocol tests in any programming language (that would currently include HTTP, and TBA protocols to be used).
- Listing of supported systems/servers, protocols
  
## Contributions and changelogs
Always added via push and commits in description. Format should be DATE-TASK/CHANGE-USER-REASON (i.e. "29/4/2024-Documentation-MS-Creation").
